Game Engine of Narrative Advanture

Introduction
-------------------

Inspired by some narrative advanture game, this project would like to develop a lightweight game engine which allow users to build narrative advanture game through simple scripts (needless the knowledge of programming).

Hopefully, this engine will provide following things:

- Visible interface for time diagram of game (stories and events time line).
- API for creating game script (Event-Condition script, varaible group script, randomize mechanic script, etc.).
- The function that export scripted game to executanle file.


About this repo
---------------
This repo will provide:
- source code of the game engine.
- Tutorial of the game engine.
- Design document of the game engine.


Note:
-----
- Since the first project developer [RimiChen](https://github.com/RimiChen) enrolled Software Engineering course in the 2015 Fall, (hopefully) this project will follow the developing process in Software Engineering.
